I am currently doing my **PhD in Computer Science at Mila (University of Montreal)** supervised by Prof. Guillaume Rabusseau. 
Previously I completed my MASc at the Vision and Image Processing lab at **University of Waterloo** under the supervision of
Prof. David Clausi and Prof. John  Zelek. I completed my undergraduate degree at the **University of Toronto** where 
I specialized in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering.


My research interests currently are at intersection of Natural Language Processing and Tensor Networks. Previously, I 
worked in computer vision on video action recognition and as well as model compression of large language models.
